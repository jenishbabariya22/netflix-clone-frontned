The project involves implementing a complete authentication system in a Node.js web application, covering user registration, login, logout, and access control for protected routes. The registration endpoint allows new users to sign up by providing their details, which are securely stored in a MongoDB database after password hashing using bcryptjs. For login, users enter their credentials, which are verified against the stored details, and a JWT (JSON Web Token) is generated to manage user sessions securely. The JWT token is used to authenticate users for accessing protected routes, ensuring that only logged-in users can view certain content. The logout process is client-handled by removing the JWT token, effectively ending the user's session. For unauthorized users, route protection is implemented via a middleware, preventing access to restricted resources without valid authentication. This ensures that sensitive routes remain secure and only registered users can access them, providing a robust mechanism for user management in the application.
